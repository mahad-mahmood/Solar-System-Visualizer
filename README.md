# 🌌 Solar System Visualizer

An interactive, real-time visualization of our solar system with realistic orbital mechanics and beautiful animations.

## ✨ Features

### 🪐 Realistic Orbital Mechanics
- **Elliptical Orbits**: Each planet follows its actual elliptical orbit with correct eccentricity
- **Accurate Orbital Periods**: Planets move at their real orbital speeds relative to each other
- **Realistic Distances**: Based on actual astronomical data (in millions of kilometers)

### 🎮 Interactive Controls
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed from 0.1x to 5x normal speed
- **Scale Control**: Zoom in/out from 0.5x to 10x scale for better visibility
- **Size Modes**: Toggle between realistic and cartoon planet sizes
- **View Centers**: Switch between Sun-centered and Earth-centered views
- **Pause/Resume**: Control animation playback
- **Reset**: Return all planets to their starting positions

### 🖱️ Interactive Elements
- **Planet Information**: Hover over any planet to see detailed information including:
  - Distance from Sun
  - Orbital period
  - Diameter
  - Mass
  - Interesting facts
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements
- **Twinkling Starfield**: Animated background with twinkling stars
- **Pulsing Sun**: The Sun glows and pulses with animated rays
- **3D Planet Effects**: Planets have realistic shading and highlights
- **Orbit Trails**: Faint orbital paths show the elliptical orbits
- **Distance Indicators**: Visual rings showing planetary distances
